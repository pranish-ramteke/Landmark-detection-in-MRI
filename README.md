Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Anatomical Landmark Detection using PyTorch.

## Introduction

Accurate detection of anatomical landmarks is an essential step in several medical imaging tasks. This repository implements a novel communicative multi-agent reinforcement learning (C-MARL) system to automatically detect landmarks in 3D medical images. C-MARL enables the agents to learn explicit communication channels, as well as implicit communication signals by sharing certain weights of the architecture among all the agents.

10 brain MRI scans each with 20 landmarks annotated from the ADNI dataset are included in the `data` folder for convenience.

## Results
Here are a few examples of the learned agents on unseen data:

* An  example  of  our  proposed  C-MARL  system  consisting  of  5  agents.  These agents are looking for 5 different landmarks in a brain MRI scan. Each agentâ€™s ROI is represented by a yellow box and centered around a blue point, while the red point is the target landmark. ROI is sampled with 3mm spacing at the beginning of every episode. The length of the circumference of red disks denotes the distance between the current and target landmarks in z-axis.
